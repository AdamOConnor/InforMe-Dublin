# Reason For choosing such a project ?

The reason I choose a project of this stature, was that I noticed that historical monuments in my own area where being forgotten about over time. My idea was to bring these places back to life with local people actually visiting these area's but also learning from when they where being used.

Not just historical buildings but the old pictures of the towns that have changed over the years which have been modified by time and different aspects of skyrocketing into the future.
